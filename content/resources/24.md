description: A view of the aligner/exposer from the other side. The paddle in the
  foreground is used to align the mask and wafer. The eyepieces are used during the
  alignment, but are faced away during the exposure. This is done because the eyepieces
  focus the light, so you could get an even more intense dose of UV by looking through
  them!
