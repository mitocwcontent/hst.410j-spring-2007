description: The foil-covered thing in the middle of this image is the spinner. A
  silicon wafer is centered on the spinner and held in place by vacuum. A glob of
  SU-8 is poured onto the wafer, as shown here. The wafer is then spun quickly to
  distribute the SU-8 evenly over the surface. In this and the next image, the brightness
  inside the spinner has been enhanced to make the features visible.
