description: "The wafer here has a glob of SU-8 on the center. After spinning, most\
  \ of the SU-8 ends up on the walls of the spinner, which is why they are covered\
  \ in foil. A thin layer remains on the wafer. The speed at which the spinner is\
  \ run helps determine the final thickness of SU-8 \u2014 the faster the spinning,\
  \ the thinner the layer. For a 40 \xB5m layer, the wafer is spun at about 10,000\
  \ RPM."
