description: The mask is held in place on the aligner, as shown here. To maximize
  the fidelity with which the mask pattern is transferred to the SU-8, the wafer is
  brought into direct contact with the mask. For this purpose, it is important to
  place the emulsion side down, so that the mask pattern is not separated from the
  wafer by the thickness of the mylar sheet.
