description: "Dino inspecting the mask. The fab facility contains a video microscope\
  \ to allow inspection of masks and of the wafers after fabrication. Notice that\
  \ the mask is still in its sleeve \u2014 the sleeves containing the masks are only\
  \ opened inside the fab, to reduce the chance that the mask gets dusty."
